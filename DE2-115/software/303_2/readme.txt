Readme - Hello World Software Example

DESCRIPTION:
Simple program that prints "Hello from Nios II"

The memory footprint of this hosted application is intended to be small (under 100 kbytes) by default
using a standard reference deisgn.

For an even smaller, reduced footprint version of this template, and an explanation of how
to reduce the memory footprint for a given application, see the
"small_hello_world" template.

CONTROLS:
SW0 - UART mode if off
	  Buttons mode if on
	  
SW1 - C implementation if off
	  sccharts implementation if on
	  
BUTTONS MODE:
KEY0 - Ventricular sence is sent to the pacemaker
KEY1 - Atrial sence is sent to the pacemaker

LEDG[7..4] - Atrial pulse is sent by the pacemaker
LEDG[3..0] - Ventricular pulse is sent by the pacemaker

PERIPHERALS USED:
This example exercises the following peripherals:
- STDOUT device (UART or JTAG UART)

SOFTWARE SOURCE FILES:
This example includes the following software source files:
- hello_world.c: Everyone needs a Hello World program, right?

BOARD/HOST REQUIREMENTS:
This example requires only a JTAG connection with a Nios Development board. If
the host communication settings are changed from JTAG UART (default) to use a
conventional UART, a serial cable between board DB-9 connector  and the host is
required.
